Measure the pixel width and height of the banana bunch.\n3. Divide these pixel values by the corresponding dimension of the image to normalize them between 0 and 1.\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you could use image recognition libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV to detect objects and their bounding boxes in images."
