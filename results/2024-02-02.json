Since the sticker is not a perfect square, it does not have a single definitive length or width, but for the purpose of this question, I will assume you want to estimate the width at the widest point, and a similar value for length since it appears roughly equal.\n\n{\n  \"length\": 2.5,\n  \"width\": 2.5\n}"
