Considering standard practices in object detection datasets, each car that's distinct enough in the image should have its own annotation.\n\nTo give an accurate count, I will examine the image and identify cars without red bounding boxes:\n\n1. There's a car on the far left without a bounding box.\n2. There is one in the middle of the road, partially obscured by a car that is annotated.\n3. On the right edge of the image, there's a partial view of a car which may or may not be considered depending on annotation guidelines. Usually, if there's a significant portion of a car visible it should be marked, but if only a tiny portion is visible it might not be.\n\nGiven that the third car is only partially visible and not all guidelines would consider it necessary to annotate such instances, I will not include it in the count. So, there are two clearly missing annotations for two fully visible cars. Here is the requested JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"missing\": 2\n}\n```"
