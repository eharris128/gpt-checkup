This distant car does not have a bounding box either.\n\nThis leads to a total of two missing annotations for cars.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"missing\": 2\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that while I can analyze the given image, determining the exact number of missing annotations can sometimes be subjective due to quality and perspective in images. If there is another car that is not clearly visible due to these factors, it might not be included in the count."
